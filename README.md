# README Generator

## Description
README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from user's input. It typically prompts the user for information about the project and then generates a README file based on the information provided. This can save time and effort for developers, who can focus on creating the project itself instead of creating documentation.

## Contributing
* Reporting issues: If you find a bug or have a feature request, you can open an issue on the project's GitHub page. This allows the maintainers of the project to track and address the problem.
* Forking the repository: You can create a copy of the project's repository in your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the code and submit them back to the original repository through a pull request.
* Submitting pull requests: After making changes to the code in your forked repository, you can submit a pull request to the original repository. A pull request is a request for the maintainers of the project to review and merge your changes into the main codebase.

* Providing feedback: You can provide feedback on issues, pull requests, and other contributions to the project through comments.
